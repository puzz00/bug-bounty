# Practical Bug Bounty

Bug bounty hunting is a proactive approach to web application security that allows ethical hackers to identify and report vulnerabilities in exchange for rewards. Companies open their applications and systems to external security researchers, creating bug bounty programs where hunters can test for flaws without fear of the feds. This collaborative model leverages the diverse expertise of the global security community, enabling companies to uncover hidden vulnerabilities before malicious actors exploit them.

Bug bounty hunting bridges the gap between organizations and skilled security researchers, providing a structured way for hunters to assist in improving security. It’s a mutually beneficial arrangement: companies benefit from increased security assurance, and hunters receive rewards, recognition (not always desirable) and the chance to legally hack stuff and hone skills. As bug bounty hunting gains traction, it has become a critical tool in the security arsenal of companies worldwide, democratizing cybersecurity and making the digital landscape more resilient.

## Why Web Application Security is Important

In today’s digital world, web applications are at the heart of many businesses, from small startups to global enterprises. These applications often hold sensitive data, manage transactions, and maintain customer trust. However, with this critical role comes a significant risk: web applications are prime targets for attackers seeking to exploit vulnerabilities. Security breaches can lead to data theft, financial loss, and serious reputational damage.

Web applications face a wide array of threats, including cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, broken authentication, and exposure of sensitive data. As these threats evolve, securing applications becomes a continual process, demanding vigilance, innovation, and expertise. Protecting web applications not only shields the users and their data but also fosters trust and reliability in the application’s brand and its services.

To summarize, the following list shows why web app security is important:

- Data protection
- Maintaining customer trust
- Legal and regulatory compliance
- Preventing disruption to business
- Protecting reputation
- Preventing financial loss
- Avoiding theft of intelectual property
- Preventing identity theft

## Security Best Practices

Ensuring web application security requires a blend of well-established practices and a proactive approach to potential threats. This section outlines essential best practices that organizations should follow to secure their applications and data effectively.

### 1. Regular Patching and Updates

One of the simplest yet most crucial practices is to keep software, libraries, and systems up to date. Many vulnerabilities arise from outdated software, as attackers often exploit known weaknesses that have been patched in recent versions. Regularly updating and patching software minimizes the attack surface and ensures applications are equipped with the latest security improvements.

### 2. Principle of Least Privilege

The principle of least privilege dictates that users, applications, and services should have the minimal level of access necessary to perform their functions. Restricting permissions limits the damage an attacker can do if they gain access to a system. It also reduces the risk of accidental data exposure and helps isolate compromised accounts or services, making security breaches easier to contain.

### 3. Secure Coding Practices

Secure coding is fundamental in preventing common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Following secure coding practices, like validating inputs, escaping output, and using prepared statements for database queries, helps eliminate weaknesses at the code level. Implementing a secure development lifecycle that includes security checks at every stage—from design to deployment is essential for maintaining a resilient application.

### 4. Secure Data Storage

Proper data storage is essential to protect sensitive information, including user credentials and personally identifiable information (PII). Best practices include encrypting data both at rest and in transit, using strong cryptographic algorithms, and ensuring data storage systems meet security standards. It’s also critical to avoid hardcoding sensitive information, such as API keys or passwords, directly in the application’s source code.

### 5. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

MFA is an effective defense against unauthorized access. By requiring users to verify their identity using multiple factors (e.g., a password and a one-time code sent to their device), MFA significantly reduces the risk of account compromise, even if passwords are stolen. Implementing MFA for all users—especially those with elevated permissions is a strong security measure that helps secure login systems.

### 6. Logging and Monitoring

Logging and monitoring provide visibility into application activity, helping organizations detect potential security incidents early. Logging key events (such as login attempts, access to sensitive data, and configuration changes) enables quick identification of suspicious behavior. Regularly reviewing logs and implementing real-time monitoring with alerts on anomalous activity are essential for effective incident detection and response.

### 7. User Training and Awareness

Human error is the most common cause of security incidents. Training users on secure practices, such as recognizing phishing attempts, using strong passwords, and reporting suspicious activity, enhances the overall security posture. Regular user training sessions and awareness campaigns are effective ways to instill a security-first mindset across an organization.

## Frameworks for Web Application Testing

Frameworks for web application testing provide structured guidance for identifying, prioritizing, and addressing security vulnerabilities. Leveraging well-established frameworks ensures that common and critical vulnerabilities are not overlooked. This section covers three widely used frameworks: the OWASP Top Ten, CWE, and the SANS 25.

### 1. OWASP Top Ten

The **Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Top Ten** is a widely respected and regularly updated list of the most critical web application security risks. Updated every few years to reflect emerging threats, the OWASP Top Ten helps organizations focus on the most prevalent and impactful vulnerabilities. Each item on the list includes descriptions, examples, and remediation recommendations, making it an essential tool for developers, testers, and security teams.

The latest OWASP Top Ten includes risks such as:
- **Broken Access Control** – Failures in enforcing user permissions, leading to unauthorized access.
- **Cryptographic Failures** – Weaknesses in protecting data, often due to poor encryption practices.
- **Injection** – Flaws like SQL injection where malicious code is executed within the application.
  
By adhering to OWASP guidelines, organizations can systematically reduce the most common security risks in their applications.

### 2. Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)

The **Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)** is a community-developed list of software and hardware weaknesses that provides a more detailed view of security issues than the OWASP Top Ten. Managed by the MITRE Corporation, CWE assigns unique identifiers to specific weaknesses, enabling detailed tracking and categorization of vulnerabilities.

CWE serves as a valuable framework for:
- **Defining Security Requirements** – Mapping common weaknesses to secure coding guidelines and standards.
- **Developing Security Testing Plans** – Identifying specific flaws to test for based on application risk profile.
- **Tracking and Mitigating Known Issues** – Using CWE identifiers to consistently track vulnerabilities and remediation.

For example, CWE-79 (Cross-Site Scripting) and CWE-89 (SQL Injection) categorize and describe specific types of vulnerabilities. CWE is widely used by developers and security teams to maintain consistent language and standards for identifying and addressing weaknesses in code.

### 3. SANS 25 (CWE/SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors)

The **SANS 25**, formally known as the **CWE/SANS Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Errors**, is a curated list of the most dangerous and impactful software weaknesses. Developed collaboratively by the SANS Institute and MITRE, the SANS 25 highlights the most serious errors that lead to severe security risks, including vulnerabilities that are both easy to find and exploit.

The SANS 25 list helps security teams:
- **Prioritize Testing** – Focusing on the most critical errors that could lead to high-impact vulnerabilities.
- **Mitigate High-Risk Issues** – Providing developers with guidance on mitigating severe vulnerabilities.
- **Standardize Security Practices** – Offering a shared language for security errors, making it easier to communicate risks and best practices.

Key vulnerabilities on the SANS 25 include buffer overflows, path traversal, and improper input validation, which can lead to a wide range of security issues. This framework is an excellent resource for focusing on vulnerabilities that have proven to be both common and damaging across applications.

## How Bug Bounty Hunting Differs from Penetration Testing

Bug bounty hunting and penetration testing are both essential approaches to identifying security vulnerabilities, but they differ significantly in scope, methodology, and focus. The primary distinction lies in the concept of *impact*: bug bounty programs are generally focused on discovering impactful, exploitable vulnerabilities, while penetration testing takes a more comprehensive approach, assessing the overall security posture of a system.

### Focus on Impact in Bug Bounty Hunting

Bug bounty hunting prioritizes vulnerabilities that present a clear, demonstrable risk to the organization. To be eligible for a reward, a reported bug must typically have an immediate impact, such as unauthorized access, data leakage, or application functionality compromise. For example, a critical finding in bug bounty hunting might be a SQL injection vulnerability that allows attackers to access sensitive data.

In contrast, penetration testing aims to assess the entire security landscape, documenting both high-impact vulnerabilities and lower-severity issues that may indicate weaknesses in the organization’s security practices. Findings in a penetration test report may include issues with limited impact on their own but that still pose security concerns, particularly when combined with other weaknesses.

### Scope and Coverage Differences

Another difference is the scope. In a penetration test, the assessment usually covers the full application or environment, providing a holistic view of security that includes infrastructure, networks, APIs, and application code. Pen testers simulate various attack scenarios to uncover vulnerabilities that could lead to a breach.

Bug bounty hunters, however, are often limited to specific parts of the application or defined assets. Organizations define the scope for bounty hunters, specifying which parts of the application they can test and often excluding certain areas. This can lead to a more targeted focus, with bounty hunters concentrating on finding high-impact bugs within allowed areas rather than a comprehensive assessment.

### Examples of Findings Exclusive to Penetration Testing

Some types of findings are commonly included in penetration testing reports but would not generally be submitted in a bug bounty program due to their low impact or limited exploitability. These findings are still valuable for strengthening overall security but do not meet the threshold for bug bounty impact. Examples include:

- **Weak Password Policy**: While a weak password policy might indicate poor security hygiene, it typically does not have an immediate exploitable impact. However, it would be documented in a penetration test report as it increases the risk of account compromise.
  
- **User Account Enumeration**: The ability to identify valid usernames through error messages or other clues (user enumeration) is often flagged in penetration testing but may not be accepted in a bug bounty program unless it is paired with a more severe vulnerability.
  
- **Outdated Software**: Running outdated software can expose an application to known vulnerabilities, yet this is typically a low-impact finding on its own. In penetration testing, outdated software versions are documented and recommended for updating, while bug bounty programs may only accept reports for outdated software if it leads to a clear, exploitable vulnerability.

### Summary

While both bug bounty hunting and penetration testing aim to strengthen application security, they serve different purposes. Bug bounty programs focus on finding impactful, exploitable vulnerabilities within a restricted scope, while penetration testing provides a broader, more systematic security assessment that covers both high- and low-severity findings across the entire application or environment.

## Understanding Scope and Ethics in Bug Bounty Hunting

### What is Scope?

In bug bounty programs, *scope* defines the boundaries of what can and cannot be tested. Scope includes specific domains, subdomains, applications, or functionalities that the organization allows researchers to test. Staying within scope is crucial for both legal and ethical reasons, ensuring that researchers don’t inadvertently break the law or disrupt services that the organization hasn’t permitted for testing.

Scope often has two main categories: *in-scope* and *out-of-scope* assets. Bug bounty programs typically provide a detailed scope document, and hunters should review this carefully before beginning any testing.

#### In-Scope Assets

In-scope assets are the parts of the application or infrastructure that the organization has explicitly approved for testing. These may include:
- **Domains and Subdomains**: Specific domains and subdomains like `www.example.com` and `app.example.com` might be listed as eligible for testing.
- **APIs**: Certain API endpoints (e.g., `api.example.com`) may be in scope, allowing hunters to assess these for security issues.
- **Mobile Applications**: Occasionally, organizations include mobile applications (Android or iOS) in their bug bounty scope.

Example of in-scope assets:
- `example.com`
- `api.example.com`
- `mobile.example.com`

#### Out-of-Scope Assets

Out-of-scope assets are explicitly excluded from testing and should not be tampered with. These often include:
- **Critical Infrastructure**: Sensitive infrastructure domains, such as corporate email systems (`mail.example.com`) or internal-only systems (`intranet.example.com`), are typically off-limits.
- **Third-Party Services**: Domains that are not directly managed by the organization, such as third-party payment processors or customer service platforms, are usually out of scope.
- **Domains Without Explicit Permission**: Any domain or asset not specifically mentioned in the in-scope list should be considered out of scope by default.

Example of out-of-scope assets:
- `mail.example.com`
- `hr.example.com`
- `backup.example.com`

Staying within the defined scope demonstrates respect for the organization’s boundaries and avoids potential legal issues.

### Guidance on Ethics in Bug Bounty Hunting

Ethics are a critical part of bug bounty hunting, guiding researchers to act responsibly and respect the organizations they’re working with. Some fundamental ethical principles include:

1. **Always Stay Within Scope**  
   Testing out-of-scope assets can lead to unintended consequences, including being vanned 🚓 If you discover a vulnerability on an out-of-scope asset accidentally, report it responsibly, but avoid further testing on it.

2. **Avoid Causing Disruption**  
   Avoid high-intensity attacks that could degrade service quality, such as DDoS, brute-force, or automated scanning without throttling. Aim to test in a way that minimizes potential disruption to the organization’s services and users.

3. **Report All Findings Honestly and Respectfully**  
   If you find a vulnerability, report it in detail but avoid exaggerating its severity. Clear, factual reporting builds trust with the organization, and respectful communication shows professionalism.

4. **Respect User Privacy**  
   Bug bounty hunting can sometimes involve sensitive data exposure. If you encounter user data avoid accessing or saving it unnecessarily. Instead, document the vulnerability and disclose it to the organization without exploiting or viewing the sensitive data.

5. **Don’t Hoard or Hold Exploits for Ransom**  
   Report vulnerabilities as soon as they’re discovered, and avoid holding onto them in the hope of a higher reward or trying to negotiate a better payout. Organizations trust bounty hunters to act in good faith, and delaying reports can compromise their security.

## Common Scoping Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

Properly understanding and respecting the scope of a bug bounty program is essential to conducting ethical and productive testing. However, scoping mistakes are a frequent issue, especially for those new to bug bounty hunting. This section highlights some common scoping mistakes and offers guidance on how to avoid them.

### 1. Testing Out-of-Scope Assets

One of the most common mistakes is testing domains, subdomains, or applications that are explicitly out of scope. This can happen when a researcher is too eager to explore new areas or doesn’t thoroughly check the provided scope document. Testing out-of-scope assets can not only void your eligibility for a reward but may also lead to 🚓

**How to Avoid This Mistake:**
- **Review Scope Documentation Carefully**: Before starting any testing, thoroughly read the program’s scope document and make a list of the approved domains, subdomains, and IP addresses. 
- **Double-Check Every Asset**: When you find a new subdomain or endpoint, cross-check it against the in-scope list to ensure it’s authorized. If it’s not explicitly listed as in-scope, assume it’s out-of-scope by default.
- **Ask for Clarification if Needed**: If you come across an asset you think should be in scope but isn’t listed, reach out to the program administrators to confirm before proceeding.

### 2. Testing for Out-of-Scope Vulnerabilities

Even when testing in-scope assets, it’s essential to check that the vulnerabilities you’re targeting fall within the defined scope. For example, some bug bounty programs exclude low-impact vulnerabilities such as information leakage or clickjacking unless they directly lead to a security risk.

**How to Avoid This Mistake:**
- **Read the Accepted Vulnerability List**: Most programs provide a list of in-scope vulnerabilities. Familiarize yourself with this list so you know which issues are eligible for a reward.
- **Skip Low-Impact Findings Unless Specified**: If the scope document excludes low-impact issues (e.g., weak password policies, minor information disclosure), avoid testing for these unless there’s a chance they might lead to something more serious.
- **Focus on Business Impact**: Prioritize vulnerabilities that have a clear, high-impact risk, such as those that could lead to unauthorized access, data leakage, or financial loss.

### 3. Overlooking Asset Restrictions Within a Scope

Some programs specify that only certain parts of an asset are in scope, such as specific directories, endpoints, or versions of an application. Ignoring these restrictions and testing the entire application can lead to unauthorized access or disruption of services.

**How to Avoid This Mistake:**
- **Check Any Restrictions on Each Asset**: Before testing, note if there are any specific restrictions on which parts of an asset can be tested (e.g., only `/api/*` endpoints). Avoid testing other parts to ensure compliance.
- **Segment Testing Efforts**: If you’re testing multiple endpoints or services within the scope, group them according to the specified limitations so you don’t accidentally cross boundaries.
- **Avoid Generic Attacks**: Broad automated scans or brute-force tests can accidentally target out-of-scope areas within an asset. Use precise, targeted testing techniques to stay within authorized segments.

### 4. Missing Scope Updates

Bug bounty program scopes can change over time, with new assets being added or old ones removed. Missing these updates can lead to unintended testing of assets that are now out of scope, resulting in disqualification of findings.

**How to Avoid This Mistake:**
- **Regularly Check Scope Updates**: Most bug bounty platforms notify researchers when a scope changes, but it’s a good practice to manually check for updates before each testing session.
- **Keep Track of Changes**: Maintain a personal document or list of in-scope assets and update it whenever the program makes changes. This helps prevent any oversights when testing.
- **Confirm Scope at the Start of a Session**: If you’re working on a bug bounty program over an extended period, double-check the scope each time you start a new session to avoid any surprises.

### 5. Failing to Understand Intent Behind Scope Rules

Sometimes, programs include specific notes or descriptions of vulnerabilities they are particularly interested in, or areas they want to prioritize testing. Ignoring these focus points can mean missing out on key findings or testing in ways the organization doesn’t need.

**How to Avoid This Mistake:**
- **Pay Attention to Program Priorities**: If a program specifies a particular focus area, like API endpoints or authorization flaws, prioritize testing in these areas to align with the organization’s goals.
- **Adhere to Any Testing Conditions**: Some programs may specify limits on test intensity or particular types of testing (e.g., no automated scans). Following these helps maintain a positive relationship with the organization and avoids accidental disruptions.

### Summary

Avoiding common scoping mistakes is crucial for successful bug bounty hunting. By carefully reviewing the program’s scope document, understanding asset and vulnerability restrictions, and regularly checking for updates, researchers can ensure they’re operating within defined boundaries and contributing effectively to the program’s security goals.

## High-Level Overview of Web Technologies

To succeed in bug bounty hunting, it’s essential to understand the core technologies that power web applications. Having a foundational knowledge of how web applications are built and function will help you identify potential vulnerabilities. This section covers key web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP, and DNS.

### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

HTML is the standard language used to structure content on the web. It defines the elements of a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images, through the use of tags. Web browsers interpret HTML to display the content in a structured format. 

**Key Points:**
- **HTML Tags**: HTML consists of various tags (e.g., `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<a>`) that define different elements.
- **Forms and Inputs**: HTML includes forms, which are often targeted in web security tests due to user inputs that can be susceptible to injection attacks like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).
- **Document Object Model (DOM)**: The DOM represents HTML as a tree structure, where each HTML element is a node. JavaScript can interact with the DOM to dynamically modify web pages, making it essential to understand for client-side vulnerabilities.

### CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

CSS is used to style and lay out web pages. While it doesn’t typically have direct security implications, it plays a role in how content is presented and can sometimes affect the user experience in ways relevant to testing.

**Key Points:**
- **Selectors and Properties**: CSS uses selectors to apply styles to specific HTML elements. Understanding how these work can help in identifying areas of the application’s structure that could impact visual-based attacks.
- **Responsive Design**: CSS enables responsive design, which adapts a website’s layout to different screen sizes and devices. Testing for security issues on different devices can help identify display-related issues that might expose vulnerabilities.

### JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language which is very similar to a cockroach - it is disgusting, despicable, found everywhere and will probably outlive humanity itself. Furthermore, it enables interactivity within web pages. Javascript is heavily used for front-end development, allowing web pages to respond dynamically to user actions, communicate with servers, and control the behavior of web elements.

**Key Points:**
- **Client-Side Scripting**: JavaScript primarily runs on the client side, which makes it a common vector for attacks like XSS and client-side injection vulnerabilities.
- **AJAX and APIs**: JavaScript often uses AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to make asynchronous HTTP requests to the server, allowing dynamic content updates without reloading the page. Bug hunters can inspect these requests to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **DOM Manipulation**: JavaScript’s ability to manipulate the DOM is useful for identifying XSS attacks, as it can inject malicious scripts into the page.

### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)

HTTP is the protocol that governs communication between clients (browsers) and web servers. Understanding HTTP is essential for bug bounty hunting, as it provides insight into how data is transmitted and received by the application.

**Key Points:**
- **Request and Response Structure**: HTTP follows a request-response model. A client sends an HTTP request to the server, which responds with the requested data. Requests consist of methods like GET (for retrieving data), POST (for sending data), and others like PUT, DELETE, and OPTIONS.
- **Headers and Status Codes**: HTTP requests and responses include headers that contain additional metadata, like content type and caching instructions. Status codes indicate the result of the request (e.g., `200` for success, `404` for not found).
- **Sessions and Cookies**: HTTP is stateless, so sessions and cookies are used to maintain state. Security issues like session fixation or cookie tampering often revolve around this aspect of HTTP.

Here is a table which shows general response codes:

| **Status Code** | **Category**               | **Meaning**                                                                                      |
|-----------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1xx Informational** | |
| 100             | Continue                   | The server has received the request headers and the client can proceed to send the request body. |
| 101             | Switching Protocols        | The requester has asked the server to switch protocols, and the server has agreed to do so.      |
| **2xx Success** | |
| 200             | OK                         | The request was successful, and the server returned the requested data.                          |
| 201             | Created                    | The request was successful, and a new resource was created as a result.                          |
| 202             | Accepted                   | The request has been accepted for processing, but it’s not completed yet.                        |
| 204             | No Content                 | The server successfully processed the request, but there is no content to return.                |
| **3xx Redirection** | |
| 301             | Moved Permanently          | The resource has been moved permanently to a new URL.                                            |
| 302             | Found                      | The resource has temporarily moved to a different URL.                                           |
| 304             | Not Modified               | The content has not changed since the last request, so the client can use a cached version.      |
| **4xx Client Error** | |
| 400             | Bad Request                | The server cannot process the request due to client-side error (e.g., malformed request syntax). |
| 401             | Unauthorized               | Authentication is required, but the credentials were missing or invalid.                         |
| 403             | Forbidden                  | The server understood the request, but refuses to authorize it.                                  |
| 404             | Not Found                  | The server could not find the requested resource.                                                |
| 405             | Method Not Allowed         | The request method is not supported for the requested resource.                                  |
| 429             | Too Many Requests          | The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time ("rate limiting").                 |
| **5xx Server Error** | |
| 500             | Internal Server Error      | The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.    |
| 501             | Not Implemented            | The server does not support the functionality required to fulfill the request.                   |
| 502             | Bad Gateway                | The server received an invalid response from an inbound server.                                  |
| 503             | Service Unavailable        | The server is temporarily unable to handle the request (e.g., due to overload or maintenance).   |
| 504             | Gateway Timeout            | The server did not receive a timely response from an upstream server.                            |

These status codes give insights into how the server responded to requests, helping bug hunters diagnose issues, identify potential misconfigurations, and understand the application's behavior in various situations.

>[!NOTE]
>Developers can custom the response codes returned so they are not always accurate though they are most of the time

### DNS (Domain Name System)

DNS is the system that translates human-readable domain names (e.g., `example.com`) into IP addresses that computers use to locate servers. While DNS is typically outside the direct scope of most bug bounty programs, understanding how DNS works can help identify potential issues related to domain security.

**Key Points:**
- **DNS Records**: DNS uses records such as A (address), CNAME (canonical name), and MX (mail exchange) to direct traffic. Bug hunters should understand these to check for subdomain takeover risks.
- **Subdomains**: Bug bounty programs often list subdomains in scope. Understanding DNS helps in finding potential subdomains, which can be points of entry.
- **DNS Security Issues**: Some attacks, like DNS spoofing, can affect how users interact with the site. Testing for misconfigured DNS records or subdomain vulnerabilities can sometimes reveal takeover opportunities.

### Summary

A foundational understanding of these core web technologies — HTML, CSS, JavaScript, HTTP, and DNS — is crucial for effective bug bounty hunting. They provide insight into how web applications operate, where vulnerabilities may lie, and how an application’s security can be tested responsibly. By mastering these concepts, you’ll be better equipped to identify, analyze, and report vulnerabilities that can improve an application’s overall security posture and even better make you some money 😃
